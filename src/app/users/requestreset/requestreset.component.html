            <p>Passwords are a pain in the neck, right??</p>
            <p>We agree - but it's the best way we have of protecting your information.
                Using them also helps us protect everyone else's information.</p>
            <p>If you do not remember your password, or you would simply like to change it, 
                please enter the email address you initially used to open your Loom account, and we will send you an email
            with a link that will allow you to set a new password on your account.  It may take a few minutes for the email 
            to travel through the interwebs before it reaches your inbox, so please be patient.</p>
            <p>If for some reason you don't receive an email allowing you to reset your password, please try again, or contact the administrator.</p>
